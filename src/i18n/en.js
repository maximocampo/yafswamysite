      'YAF SWAMY LOOKS BACK AT A CHAOTIC YEAR WITH THEIR NEW SINGLE: 2020',
      'Mexico City-based experimental indie band YAF SWAMY continue to explore their genre-bending sound through their new single “2020”, a chaotic song that combines elements of hyper-pop, trap inspired beats, and corrosive synthwave.',
      'Following the release of their first project YERBO FLASHBACKS in 2020, an exploration of artificial intelligence technology in writing and producing music, Yaf Swamy takes their music to a new direction with their new single “2020.”',
      'The new track revisits lyrics originally written by vocalist Santiago Cueto in 2019 as he envisioned the dawn of the 2020s, with new musical arrangements that take inspiration from A. G. Cook’s violent synths to Playboi Carti’s melodic and heavy 808s to create a bizarrely saturated atmosphere that encompases the hyper-tense year that 2020 was.'
